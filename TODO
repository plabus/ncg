TODO:
-----

Configuration I/O:
-- restart
-- special file format?
-- EVs within configs?
-- need to save:
    N, P, Q, start(H/C)/restart, RNG state, g2, g4

Always write out action with config

struct for clifford stuff (shall this be integrated into Matrix_Properties??)

One struct for all matrices including data (3d array) and parameters (incl. Clifford) ???

Guarantee trace condition for L_TYPE when contructing new candiate

Fixed RNG seed

Separate utility for EV measurements

Dirac stencil & Arnoldi


PROGRESSING:
------------

Calculate action for Tr D^4 when initalising & Testing S against deltaS for g4 != 0

One binary only:
-- parameter read in
   (a) command line args
   (b) ini files
-- what to pass?
-- need
    write out frequency, step size


DONE:
-----

Just chain generation w/o MKL
Autotune acceptance rate
Hot start in range / NO max element
Allowing to switch between DP/SP (using macros for compile time decision??)
