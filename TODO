TODO:
-----

write out configurations:
-- need to save:
    N, P, Q, g2, g4, #conf
-- restart
-- special file format?
-- EVs within configs?

One struct for all matrices including data (3d array) and parameters (incl. Clifford) ???

Fixed RNG seed

Separate utility for EV measurements

Dirac stencil & Arnoldi


PROGRESSING:
------------

Guarantee trace condition for L_TYPE when contructing new candiate

One binary only:
-- parameter read in
   (a) command line args
   (b) ini files
-- what to pass? --> n, p, q, g2, g4, chain_length, write_out_freq


DONE:
-----

Calculate action for full S = Tr D^4 when initalising/write out
 & Testing S against deltaS for g4 != 0 (done+correct)
 NOTE: cannot accumulate deltaS to some global variable action due to rounding errors!
Always write out action with config
struct for clifford stuff (integrated into Matrix_Properties)
Just chain generation w/o MKL
Autotune acceptance rate
Hot start in range / NO max element
Allowing to switch between DP/SP (using macros for compile time decision??)
